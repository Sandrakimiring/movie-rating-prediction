# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## Overview

The **Movie Rating Prediction** project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, this project aims to build a model that can accurately estimate the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between movie features and their ratings, and to build a regression model that predicts movie ratings. By understanding the factors that influence movie ratings, this model can be used for various applications, such as recommending movies based on predicted ratings or identifying trends in movie preferences.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting meaningful features from raw data such as genre, director, and actors.
- **Machine Learning:** Building a regression model to predict movie ratings.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance to ensure it is capable of making accurate predictions.

## Techniques Used

- **Data Analysis:** Understanding the distribution and relationships in the dataset.
- **Regression Modeling:** Using linear regression or other appropriate regression techniques to predict ratings.
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming categorical features (like genre and director) into numerical formats that can be used in machine learning models.

## Dataset

This project uses historical movie data that includes various features such as:
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Movie title
- IMDB rating

The dataset can be accessed through the Kaggle notebook provided below.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sandrakimiring/movie-rating-prediction.git
   ```
   
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (check the Kaggle link).
2. Run the Python script `movie_rating_prediction.py` to train and evaluate the model.

```bash
python movie_rating_prediction.py
```

## Kaggle Notebook

## Results

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, and the predictions are compared with the actual ratings to assess accuracy.
